# main.py

-	The main.py in given the test data.	It creates two arrays Genuine and Imposter, with a range of `res`. 

-	Every index i, store number of Genuine and Imposter between i and i+res respectively.

-	The cummulative of both the arrays stores total number of Genuine/Imposter at that corresponding index.

- The cummulative array is divided by total number of Genuine/Imposter to obtain FRR and FAR.

- The final array stores abs difference of the two array, the index of minimum of final gives the threshold.

# FAR.py and FRR.py

- The ground truth, 1/0 is seen and score is compared against threshold, correspondingly entry corresponding to FAR and FRR are printed.

# CRR.py

- Every (Subject1, PhotoID1) is compared against all corresponding (Subject2, PhotoID2), the lowest and higgest score is noted.

- If the Subject1 == Subject2 for lowest entry, rank=1 is printed in last column.

- (Total number of 1 )/ (Total entries) gives CRR
